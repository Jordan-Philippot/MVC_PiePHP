# MVC_PiePHP
## Welcome to MVC_PiePHP!

### The goal of this web project is to initiate learning of frameworks by recoding the first functionalities,
### such as a router, autoloader and render.
#### A cleaner URL is not negligible in passing!
#### I will content myself here with presenting the project in its form, but I will be delighted to discuss the code with you,
#### and possible improvements :)

#### To concretely test the result, a small website associated with a cinema database (films + members)
##### Some animations are available in GSAP (Greesocks Animation)


###### The home page is therefore in the form of film titles (ten) with a simple search on the titles.

##### At the click, the information of the film is available. If a user is logged in, they can be added
##### the film to its history and leave a review.

##### They can also choose a subscription, consult their history or even check the last film they watched.

#### Ah, I forgot! A page containing all genres is accessible without connection :)
